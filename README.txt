This sofware product is developed on the based of pxicel wise image analysis using convolutional neural network. Also, here performance of code is improved by optimizing the serial code into parallel code. 
Under the root directory code\ directory contain source code of the programe and data\ directory contain data set.
In the code/ directory optimal_parallel_algo, serial contain serial code, parallel directory containing optimize parallel code by OpenMP and in optimal_parallel_algo containing MPI-OpenMP optimize code.
Data set is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dstl-satellite-imagery-feature-detection and extracted to this directory.
 You can run the programe using Makefile. Plase, the file for detail.
Though this programme work to my system with out showing any problem, you can test it at your own rish.
